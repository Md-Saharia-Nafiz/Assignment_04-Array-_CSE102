# Assignment Title: Basic Array Operations in C



## Description:
This assignment is designed to demonstrate the basic operations and functionalities of arrays using the [programming language name, e.g., C/Python/Java]. Arrays are a fundamental data structure that allows storing multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

* In this task, we perform various array operations such as:

* Declaring and initializing an array

* Taking user input and storing values

* Printing all array elements

* Finding maximum and minimum values

* Calculating sum and average

* Searching for a specific value

* Updating or modifying elements in the array

This assignment helps build a strong foundation for working with arrays and improves logical thinking through practical implementation of different array-based problems.
## 💡 Key Concepts Used:
(i) Array Declaration & Initialization
Creating arrays with fixed size and assigning initial values.

(ii) User Input Handling
Taking inputs from the user and storing them in an array.

(iii) Array Traversal
Looping through the array to access each element.

(iv) Searching Algorithms
Finding a specific value inside the array (e.g., linear search).

(v) Finding Maximum and Minimum
Identifying the largest and smallest values in the array.

(vi) Sum and Average Calculation
Summing up all the elements and calculating the average.

(vii) Element Modification
Updating or changing the value of array elements based on index.

(viii) Conditional Logic
Applying if/else or switch-case to perform operations based on user choices or values.

(ix) Looping Structures
Using for, while, or do-while loops to perform repeated operations.

(x) Basic Debugging & Output Display
Showing user-friendly output and verifying correctness of logic.
## ✨ Features:
✅ Array Creation – Fixed-size array declaration and initialization

🧾 User Input Support – Input values directly into the array from the user

🔁 Display Array Elements – Print all elements in a readable format

🔍 Search Functionality – Find a specific value within the array (Linear Search)

📈 Maximum & Minimum Finder – Identify the highest and lowest values

➕ Sum & Average Calculator – Compute the total and mean of array values

🔄 Element Update/Modification – Change specific element(s) in the array

🎯 Index-based Access – Access or edit any value using its index

🚫 Input Validation (if used) – Ensures only valid data is accepted

💡 Clean and Understandable Logic – Beginner-friendly approach for learning array concepts


## 🔔Purpose:
The primary purpose of this assignment is to strengthen the foundational understanding of arrays, one of the most essential data structures in programming. Through this assignment, learners will:

* Gain hands-on experience with array declaration, initialization, and usage

* Understand how to traverse and manipulate array data efficiently

* Develop problem-solving skills by applying basic logic using arrays

* Learn to perform common operations such as search, sum, average, max/min

* Build confidence in using loops, conditions, and indexing in a structured way

* Prepare for more advanced data structures and algorithmic thinking in future tasks

This assignment is especially helpful for beginners who are starting their journey in programming and data structure fundamentals.
